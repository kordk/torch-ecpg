The following explains how to save a docker image as a file that can
be moved to a new machine, and how to load that image once moved.

To list images available for saving:

$ docker image ls

To save a docker image:

$ docker save tecpg-container | bzip2 > tecpg-container.tar.bz2

Where "tecpg-container" is the image name (found with above list
command if unsure). Bzip2 could be replaced with gzip if one
preferred. Either way, expect this command to take some time to
run. The tecpg-container image is around 5.3G after compression.

After transferring the image to a new host, load the compressed tar
file as follows:

$ docker load -i tecpg-container.tar.b2

Again, expect the unzipping to take some time.
