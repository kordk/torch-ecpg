# tecpg

Torch-eCpG is a GPU enabled expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) mapper to identify expression accociated CpG (eCpG) loci with python CLI using pytorch.

If you use Torch-eCpG in your research, please cite the following paper: Kober KM, Berger LG, Roy R, Olshen A. Torch-eCpG: A fast and scalable eQTM mapper for thousands of molecular phenotypes with graphical processing units. 2024. BMC Bioinformatics. DOI: 10.1186/s12859-024-05670-4

## Installation

Pip install from github using `git+https://`.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kordk/torch-ecpg.git
```

If you want to be able to edit the code for debugging and development, install in editable mode and do not remove the directory.

```bash
cd [path/to/code/directory]
git clone https://github.com/kordk/torch-ecpg.git
cd tecpg
pip install --editable .
```

`tecpg` is an entry point in the command line than calls the root CLI function. If the installation was successful, running `tecpg --help` should provide help with the command line interface.

If you have issues with using `pip` in the command line, try `python -m pip` or `python3 -m pip`.

## CUDA

`tecpg` can calculate on the CPU or on a CUDA enabled GPU device. CUDA devices are generally faster than CPU computations for sufficiently large inputs.

The program will automatically determine whether there is a CUDA enabled device and use it if available. To force calculation on the CPU, set the `--threads` option to a nonzero integer. This will also set the number of CPU threads used.

## Input data

Methylation values, gene expression values, and covariates are provided in CSV or TSV files in the `<working>/data` directory. For methylation and gene expression, columns are for individual samples and each row is for a loci. For the covariates, the columns are the type of covariate and the rows are the sample. Annotation files are used for region filtration and are stored in the `<working>/annot`. They use the `BED6` standard and store the positions of the methylation or gene expression loci.

## Output

`tecpg run mlr` without chunking creates one output file named out.csv by default in the output directory. If any chunking is used, methylation chuking, gene expression chunking, or both, potentially multiple files are created in the output directory. They are labeled `{methylation chunk number}-{gene expression chunk number}.csv`.

The rows labels of a csv output file indicate the gene expression id and the methylation id. The columns indicate what regression results that column represents. Methylation related labels are prefixed with `mt_`, and gene expression related labels are prefixed with `gt_`. The four regression results returned are the estimate `est`, the standard error `err`, the Student's T statistic `t`, and the p-value `p`.

## Chunking

If the input is too large, the computational device may run out of memory. Chunking can help prevent this by partitioning the data into chunks that are computed and saved separately. Chunking sacrifices parallelization, and thus speed, for lower memory. Avoid chunking wherever possible for speed.

For `tecpg run mlr`, there are two types of chunking: methylation chunking and gene expression chunking. Gene expression chunking is preferable to methylation chunking if possible, as it sacrifices parallelization less. Chunking should be avoided unless required to conform to memory constraints. Use `tepcg chunks` to estimate the number of gene expression loci per chunk given certain parameters.

## Filtration

You may want to include only certain regression results. There are two ways of filtering the results:

1. P-value filtration - all p-values are computed first. Then, regression results with a p-value above a supplied threshold are excluded from the output. This decreases output size and thus increases speed as saving is an expensive operation.
2. Region filtration - region filtration requires annotation files that dictate the positions of methylation and gene expression ids. Then, regressions are filtered by one of the following methods:
   - Cis: the position of the gene expression id and methylation id is within a supplied window and they lie on the same chromosome.
   - Distal: the position of the gene expression id and methylation id is outside of a supplied window and they lie on the same chromosome.
   - Trans: the gene expression id and methylation id lie on different chromosomes.
   - All: no filtration.

P-value filtration filters results after calculating the regression. Region filtration filters the input before the regression results are computed.

## MLR approximate p-values

The p-values returned by `tecpg run mlr` are approximations using the normal distribution CDF. This approximation is more accurate for larger degrees of freedom. As the number of degrees of freedom approaches $+\infty$, the CDF of the normal distribution and the Student's T distribution approach. The approximation is done because pytorch does not support the Student CDF and does not have the needed funtions to implement it efficiently.

For example:

- For 336 degrees of freedom and test t-statistic of 1.877, the percent difference between the normal CDF and Student CDF is 0.04469%.
- For 50 degrees of freedom and test t-statistic of 1.877, the percent difference between the normal CDF and Student CDF is 0.30206%.

The user should determine whether this accuracy is suitable for the task and the degrees of freedom.

This image from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution shows the deviation of the Student's T distribution CDF from the normal CDF represented as $v=+\infty$:

## Documentation

Currently, the README and the `tecpg ... --help` commands serve as documentation. Within the code, the function docstrings provide a lot of information about the function. The extensive type hints give added insight into the purpose of functions.

## Demonstration

Here is a demonstration of tecpg using real data publicly available from the n=340 participants from the Grady Trauma Project (GTP) (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession numbers GSE72680, GSE58137). The participants were assayed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (n=349,220 CpG loci) and HumanHT-12 (n=39,353 expression probes) arrays.

1. Create the evaluation directory
```bash
mkdir test; cd test
```

2. Download and prepare the GTP example dataset
```bash
tecpg data gtp
```

3. Copy and rename the demo annotation files to their default locations. We created these annotation files to be used with these arrays. The users will need to create their own for datasets using other arrays or measuring approaches (e.g., RNA-seq).


```bash
mkdir annot
cp ../demo/annoEPIC.hg19.bed6 annot/M.bed6
cp ../demo/annoHT12.hg19.bed6 annot/G.bed6
```

4. Run the CIS loci analysis. This analysis has a small memory footprint and completes quickly.
```bash
tecpg run mlr --help

## Selecting a GPU when multiple are available

We have run into this issue when using a development system or a cluster (e.g., Sun Grid Engine) where the system has numerous GPUs and selection is necessary.

Here, we see GPU 0 is the A2 (previous one) and GPU 1 is the L4 (new one).

Selection of the GPU to use can be done through software (e.g., https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/selecting-the-gpu/20276) or using the shell. For software that we are not going to be editing directly (e.g., tecpg), we use the shell variable direction.
 
The the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES can be set when you call python.
 
To use the A2 GPU, the following re-mapping works:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,0 python tecpg run mlr --all --p-thresh 0.000001 -g 100 -m 100000
```

To use the L4 GPU, the following re-mapping works:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python tecpg run mlr --all --p-thresh 0.000001 -g 100 -m 100000
```
